# SWEN444 - Human Centered Requirements & Design

This project is the interaction prototype of TEMPiN, a mobile web application which allows individuals find temporary jobs nearby.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). You must also have [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) which often comes bundled with Node.

### Installing

1. Open a command line terminal.

2. Change directories (`cd`) to this directory.

3. Start the server by running `npm start`

4. Open a browser with a mobile emulator (like [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/) and visit `localhost:3000`

5. Switch to the browser's mobile emulator, and you're good to go!

6. To stop the server, press `Control-C` in the terminal running the server.
