# Status Report for Weeks 9 & 10

We performed a Heuristic Evaluation on our prototype wireframes. Brandon got the programmed prototype setup and started working on it. While much is left to do, now that we have distributed tasks, development should pick up and be completed on time.

## What We Did

### Meetings

10-23-2016:

- Introduction to JavaScript
- Heuristic Evaluation Notes

Attendance:

- Bill (15 min)
- Brandon (75 min)
- Byron (75 min)
- Joshua (75 min)
- Daniel (75 min)

10-30-2016:

- Went Over Setting Up Website / Webstorm IDE / NPM
- Brandon Explained How the Website Code Currently Works

- Brandon (60 min)
- Byron (60 min)
- Joshua (60 min)
- Daniel (60 min)

### Project

Program Prototype

- Brandon (~8 hours)

Recruited Testers

- Joshua (5 min)
- Brandon (5 min)

Write & Post Blog Post

- Joshua (20 min) (10-30-2016)
- Bill (20 min) (10-30-2016)

## What Weâ€™re Doing

- Breaking Up Project into Separate Pieces to Work on Individually

## What We Will Do

- Program the Prototype (beta)
- Finish the Test Plan
- Finish Recruiting Testers

## Issues & Potential Risks

We may have less people available the next few weeks due to family members visiting.

Dividing up tasks may be challenging depending on how tightly coupled parts of the website are. Also, everyone is at different ability levels for web development, so it may take some people longer to complete tasks.

We are also working on several other group projects for other classes, so we can't exclusively devote our time to programming this prototype.
