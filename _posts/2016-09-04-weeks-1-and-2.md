# Status Report for Weeks 1 & 2

The past two weeks were mainly spent forming our team and establishing our project idea.

We decided that we will be building the interface for a geolocation-based website where people in developing countries can find short-term work nearby. People who need workers will be able to post job listings, and people looking for work will be able to see postings of jobs nearby and apply for them. The hiring process will be simple and quick so that work can begin immediately, while minimizing risk for both parties.

We will be developing this idea as a mobile-first web-app, and it will work on both mobile phones and desktop computers, but our primary focus is for mobile phones so that we can leverage their built-in GPS. We will develop the app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript adhering to responsive design principles. We hope to use the Google Maps API for map data and location analysis.

## Issues & Potential Risks

We may have difficulties meeting all of our users this week and their responses may not be useful. We will try to meet all of them and ask probing questions that will give us useful information.

There are a lot of components involved in next week’s deliverable. We will schedule more meetings during the week to prevent waiting until Sunday to complete it all.

There’s only one computer in the team rooms. We will move somewhere else that has more computers if people forget their laptops so that we aren’t wasting man-hours.
