# Status Report for Weeks 5 & 6

The past two weeks were spent refining our project's work roles and flow diagram, describing interactions with Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA), and creating sketches and wireframes for the temporary work app. We created the sketches by considering a persona who may use our system, making individual sketches using "design thinking" of what we believed would provide that persona the best user experience, and then we combined our thoughts into a final sketch. Finally, the group sketch was refined into a wireframe.

We also made sketches for the Case Study taxi service.

## Issues & Potential Risks

Our team has reached the performing stage of development and all issues have been resolved. It is possible that we will disagree on the technology chosen for prototyping, but that is not something that we are anticipating will drastically affect our progress.
