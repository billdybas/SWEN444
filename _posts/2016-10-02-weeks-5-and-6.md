# Status Report for Weeks 5 & 6

The past two weeks were spent creating sketches and wireframes for our temporary work app.

To accomplish this, we took the information we gained from interviews and created a persona that matched a particular group of potential users.  We then each created a sketch of what we believed would give the userthe best experience and combined our ideas into a final version.

Once we had our sketch completed, we needed to create a wireframe.  Using the persona once again, we mapped out the interface of our app based on other popular apps such as google maps.

## Issues & Potential Risks

Our team has reached the performing stage of development and all issues have been resolved.  It is possible that we will disagree on the technology used for the prototyping, but that is not something that will drastically affect the project.
