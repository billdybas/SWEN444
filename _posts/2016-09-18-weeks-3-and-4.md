# Status Report for Weeks 3 & 4

The past two weeks were spent identifying and analyzing the users for our project. We first interviewed individuals with background knowledge of our target market, created work roles and a work flow diagram from those interviews, and finally created work activity notes and a Work Activity Affinity Diagram (WAAD) from those notes.

We did similar tasks relating to the Case Study as well as beginning to model user interactions with Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA).
